Microsoft codefundo challenge

An application to secure the process of voting in a democratic nation.
For almost all the countries there will be identification proof with biometric informations (prerequisite), we will make use of this in our bloack chain application to validate whether a particular voter has already voted or not.
This App mainly focuses on Indian Voting System and makes use of Aadhar authenticaton.
Primarily the authorities need to link Aadhar with the Voter id,When the voter comes to vote they have to validate with the biometric and then they can vote in the voter machine. As there is strict rule where we cant use any other electronic machine apart from the voter machine in India, we wont be able to build a platform for voters to vote for a particulate candidate.


#Deliverables for the first version:
    Application to authenticate whether a voter already used thier vote.
